## Howdy! I'm JD üëãüòÅ

I'm a full stack software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React. I leverage my engineering and project management backgrounds to deconstruct complex problems and drive them to resolution.

When I'm not at the computer, I'm running, lifting, or skating. One of my favorite things to do in new cities is explore on my skates.

Most recently, I built Nimbus, a lightweight, open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) deployment framework built for small teams and individuals.
